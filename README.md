# Predicting-Fraudulent-Transactions

### Developed a model for predicting fraudulent transactions and got insights from the model to develop an actionable plan. 

### <ins> Results Walkthrough:</ins>

#### --> All preprocessing steps, data analysis, and visualizations were done.
#### --> Features are selected on the basis of Chi Square test and Pearson Correlation.
#### --> Selected variables based on their relevance and predictive power for fraud detection.
#### --> Employed an XGBoost classifier with class weights to handle class imbalance.
#### --> Achieved high accuracy (100%), precision (96%), and recall (64%) for detecting fraudulent transactions.
#### --> ROC-AUC score of 0.999 indicates excellent discriminatory power of the model.
#### --> Recommend implementing real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection algorithms, and two-factor authentication.
#### --> Regular updates to security infrastructure and employee training are essential for fraud prevention.
#### --> Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as fraud detection rate, false positive rate, and overall transaction security metrics.
#### --> Conduct regular audits and reviews to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures.
